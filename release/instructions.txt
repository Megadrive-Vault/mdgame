Run play.bat, which will open the emulator with the game.

The default keys are:

Player 1:
Arrows: Move
Enter: Start
O: Jump
P: Slap
[: Dash

Player 2:
T, G, F, H: Move
Rshift: Start
A: Jump
S: Slap
D: Dash

I recommend using a gamepad for at least one player. Recongfigure keys by 
going to Options -> Set Config -> Controllers.
