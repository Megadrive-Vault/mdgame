Swan:
 learned:
  - How to represent and generate a discrete bezier curve for use with programmed movement.
  - How to write an LD script
  - Basic Genesis VDP usage (from C).
  - Basic FM synth tracker usage.
 Review of tools:
  - Genesis is predictable.
  - The primary Genesis interface library used, SGDK, was at times hindering, especially in it's default build system.
  - Using Unix utilities and programs on Windows is abysmal. (ie. gcc, ld, git, objcopy)
